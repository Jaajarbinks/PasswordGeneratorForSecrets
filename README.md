# PasswordGenerator
so on my password generator i wanted to make it so that my password would take from all types of charactors and place at lest one type in there no matter how many charactors i used.
I used the prompt box to see what people wanted to use in the password exp: symbols,letters,numbers. Unless they leave that charactor set out.
